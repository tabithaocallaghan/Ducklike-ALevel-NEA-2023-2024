# Ducklike-ALevel-NEA-2023-2024
These are the files for my Computer Science ALevel NEA video game called Ducklike. 
It's a randomly generated platformer that follows the protagonist Miles Mallard as he fights his way through a forest to defend his village from Tamiko. 
The characters are all designed for my Art ALevel coursework which I adapted to a pixel art style. I used assets from a number of online sources which are credited in game and below.
